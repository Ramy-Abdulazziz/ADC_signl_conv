# ADC_signl_conv
This programs interfaces with the AVR128DB48 MCU and onboard ADC to display voltage levels on attached LED display. 
The output of an MCP9700A is connected to AIN11 (PE3) of the AVR128DB48. The result of conversion is scaled and the binary ADC result is converted to a binary representation of the temperature in degrees Celsius.
